In this project, I have performed NLP on Flipkartâ€™s customer reviews for products particularly belonging to the electronics category .
I have tried building various models with NLP to find the best fit for the requirement.
Also, I have conducted a sentiment analysis using 2 pre-trained models: TextBlob and Vader.
Plus, I have traced the most frequently used keywords in the reviews using WordCloud.
